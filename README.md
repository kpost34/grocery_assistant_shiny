# **Grocery Assistant Shiny App**
App helps someone maintain a database of dishes, create meal plans, and output grocery lists

## Summary
This app is the ultimate helper for someone who loves cooking but doesn't want the hassle of writing or typing up a grocery list. Dishes can be added to a database via form entry or in batches by file. The database can then be viewed, modified, and downloaded using the app. When a grocery list is needed, simply select the dishes you plan to prepare, make any last-minute adjustments, and deliver it via screenshot, pdf, or email! A database can be maintained through uploading and downloading of external files. But to take full advantage of the app, use a user id so that you can save and load your database from the app and append dish images.
